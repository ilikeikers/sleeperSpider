"""
A collection of utilities to make storing data from the Sleeper API calls easier

When calling the players, Sleeper's api call returns a pretty large file to download (like 12 MB).
They request that that API endpoint is only called once per day. I call that endpoint manually and store it in a file.

Example commands in a terminal:
cd ~/path/to/working/directory
curl "https://api.sleeper.app/v1/players/nfl" -o players.json

This saves that data in a file that I can use throughout these function.
