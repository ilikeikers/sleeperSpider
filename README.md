# sleeperSpider
get sleeper info using their public API

This is my new (slightly better) attempt to collect NFL Player Info and then sort them into a ranking list. This is an upgrade from the idea started in the "fantasy2020" Repo.

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

I'm still working on updating this to work well. This is a learning project more than it is a useful one. It uses sqlite3 for the database, and this is my first time actively working with a database.
That has been a fun project, but it has taken me awhile to wrap my head around how tables are supposed to interact with eachother and normalize them appropriately. It still has a long way to go, and

This is also a huge upgrade from the previous project in that it uses the public api instead of relying on scraping tables off the web.
